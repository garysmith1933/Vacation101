HOW IT WORKS

Main Activity: This is the home page of the application, clicking on it will send you to the vacation list.

Vacation List: This page is used to show vacations added by the user. Clicking on any of the vacation names here will lead to the vacation details page with details about the vacation. 
The + button on the bottom right corner will allow you to add and update a vacation by leading to the vacation details page. 

Vacation Details: This page is where users will start create their vacations by adding the vacation info. To save the information, click on the 3 dots on the right corner of the phone and tap on "Save Vacation"
This is also how you update your vacation information after it is created if you want to make changes. Delete Vacation will remove the vacation all together, Share Vacation Details allows the user to share the current vacation details via text messages. 
Notify Start Date sets up a notification to remind you of the start date. You have to pick the date first in order for this to work. The same can be said for the Notify End Date, that will notify the user of the last day of their vacation.
If there are excursions associated with the vacation, you will see the list of them on this page. Tapping on an excursion name or the + button will lead you to the Excursion details page, where you will be able to update info about the excursion.

Excursion Details: This page is where users add their excursion info to existing vacations. Just like the vacation details page, excursions can be added, updated, and deleted here using the menu that appears by tapping on the 3 dots on the right corner of the screen.
Also just like the vacation details page, users are able to get notifications of the start date of their excursion. Its important to know that the date must be set for this to work. The date must also be in the range of the chosen vacations start and end dates, failure to do so will result in an error.
This page includes a drop menu that allows the user to choose which vacation to associate the excursion to. You can change this at any time. 

All pages except for the home page have a back button to navigate back to the previous page.

APK INFORMATION: The signed APK is deployed on Android 8 API 26.
